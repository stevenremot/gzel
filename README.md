# Gzel

## Description

Gzel aims to provide a framework for creating basic 2d games in
webassembly. The design goals are:

* defining games as self-contained webassembly files
* being web-agnostic, so that a game can be run natively too
* having a very simple API to make new implementations easily

## Documentation

The `examples/` folder is the only documentation for now.
